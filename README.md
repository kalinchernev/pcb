## Setup

0. You need to install [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Clone the repo and `npm install` to get dependencies
2. Create a `config.json` in your home directory with similar structure of config.dist.json (you can just copy this file to config.json and add your values, i.e. `cp config.dist.json ~/config.json`)
3. Create an app (bot) and take its handle, id, etc. for the config file
4. Add the following "Messaging endpoint" in the bot settings page https://dev.botframework.com/bots?id=YOUR_BOT_ID as https://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS/api/messages
5. Check out the "Useful links" section for further details
